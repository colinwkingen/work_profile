# Work Profile Website

## Created by Colin Kingen

### Tools:
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap 3
* Atom text editor
* Git version control

### Description
 This is a portfolio website for me to show off projects as a web developer.
 It's kinda cheesy, but I learned alot making it and had fun.
 There is a bunch of custom CSS modifying most of the visual Bootstrap
 elements involved, removing the color and styles to see how they operate
 without losing their usability.
[  You can visit the live site at gh-pages:](http://colinwkingen.github.io/work_profile/)


### Notes
 There are custom Bootstrap styles used in the column placement,
 navigation bar and implemented to remove certain things in mobile view.

### Bugs
 Mobile still isn't perfect. Resizing the nav bar and working with margins
 will make the site work better on mobile devices.
 There is a slight zoom issue on mobile.
 Some text wraps poorly in mobile, both in columns and nav.
